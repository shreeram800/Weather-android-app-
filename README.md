## 🎯 Technologies Used
- *Java Programming Language*
- *Retrofit (version 2.9.0)*
- *OpenWeatherMap API*: <sup>The project uses the API version with "metric" units (degrees Celsius).<sup>
- *UI Using XML Layouts*
- *Android Studio (version 4.2.2)*

## 🔧 Functionality
📱**Main Screen:** The app opens to a main screen where users can input the city name they want to check the weather for.

🌍**Weather Data Retrieval:** After entering a city name and clicking "Gey weather" the app sends a request to an external weather API to retrieve weather data for the specified city.

☀️**Display Weather Information:**
- City name
- Current temperature in degrees Celsius
- Weather description (e.g., "Cloudy," "Sunny," "Rainy")
- Humidity percentage
- Wind speed in meters per second
- Atmospheric pressure in hPa (hectopascal)
- Weather icon corresponding to the current weather conditions
 
⚠️**Error Handling:** The app handles various types of errors:
- If the specified text isn't a city name, it displays an error message like "City not found."
- If the city's name is specified, but there is no information about the weather in the API, the appropriate message will be displayed.
- If there's an issue with the API or network connectivity, it shows a network error message.
